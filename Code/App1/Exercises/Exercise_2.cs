        /*
        1. Ask the user for their first and last name separately, then print a full greeting using string interpolation.

        2. Ask the user for their height in meters (double), convert it to int using both (int) and Convert.ToInt32(), and print both results.

        3. Ask the user for a number as a string.
           - Try to parse it using TryParse.
           - If successful, print its double value (multiply by 2).
           - If unsuccessful, print "Invalid input!"

        4. Ask for two numbers from the user and divide them.
           - Validate that the denominator is not zero.
           - If zero, print an error message.
           - Otherwise, print the division result.

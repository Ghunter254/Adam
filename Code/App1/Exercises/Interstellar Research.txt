Travel time and cost are pegged to the following modifiers.
    1. Distance coefficient
        I want to add a flat cost increase to interstellar destinations as well
            Moon = 5.58
            Mercury = 8.17
            Venus = 8.18
            Mars = 8.36
                Phobos = 8.36
                Deimos = 8.36
            Jupiter = 8.89
                Europa = 8.89
                Io = 8.89
                Ganymede = 8.89
            Saturn = 9.15
                Titan = 9.15
                Enceladus = 9.15
            Uranus = 9.46
            Neptune = 9.65
            Proxima Centauri B = 13.64


    2. Cargo Weight(in tons)
        Cargo weight should add a flat amount as well(in millions of dollars)
        The minimum shipment should be 1 ton at 10$ per ton.
        Any amount above 500 tons will then incur a much larger 50$ per ton fee
    
    3. Cargo type
        I want cargo types to be handled using multipliers pegged to the cargo weight via switch cases
            a. Regular = 1.0
            b. Fragile = 1.5
            c. Extra Fragile = 4
            d. Liquid = 6
            e. Gas = 6.5
    
    4. Interstellar modifier  
        This modifier is just a flat increase based on a boolean variable. This will be in the planets list.
        If the planet is in interstellar space, it adds an extra 1000 to cost due to the need for storing exotic matter.

Travel time formula
Travel time = Distance coefficient*cargo type modifier

Travel cost formula
Travel cost = distance coefficient*100 + (Cargo weight*10 + extra weight$50)*cargo type + interstellar modifier

    Here we shall work to improve the project in exercise 4.
    1. Ask the user to enter their full name.
        - Instead of asking the user for their name in two parts, ask them for their full name in one operation.
        - Print out a Hello Message with their firstname only in CAPS
        - Remember to create a different student class.

    2. The ask the User if they wish to generate their report card.
        - Check if the sentence contains the word "yes".
        - If it contains yes then print out a statement with their full name and a grade.

This is a time travel thing.
Remember to structure it into multiple classes.

Find a command to pause the console for an amount of time
        Thread.Sleep(1000) - pauses the terminal for 1 second


Find a command to change the terminal text colour
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red; //This changes the colour to green
        Console.ResetColor();                       //This resets the terminal colour back


Find a command to make the case of an input insignificant
        string input = Console.ReadLine().Trim().ToLower();
        string input = Console.ReadLine().Trim().ToUpper();  // The trim removes spaces and shi


Find a command to generate a random event each year using a RNG
        Random value = new Random();
        int value = value.Next(0, 101); // generates a random number from 1 to 100.(last value is excluded)
        
Find a way to prevent energy from going above 100 or below 0
        Value = Math.Clamp(value, 0, 100);



OPERATION PHASES

Phase 1(WHILE loop)
    In this phase, a while loop runs that allows the user to stabilize the craft
    This happens in increments and decrements of 20 and 10
    The loop must begin at zero and end at 100
    UNSTABLE must be in yellow
    STABILIZE must be in green
    When we get to 100 percent power the loop terminates and moves on

Phase 2(FOR loop)
In this phase, the user actually makes their trip
The user inputs starting date and destination date
Make it so that the machine detects what direction in time they are moving in(does the loop count up or down)

In the loop
    Pause for a time
    Generate a random number(1-10)
        Each random number event will either take or give energy
    If energy drops to zero or lower, catastrophic failure

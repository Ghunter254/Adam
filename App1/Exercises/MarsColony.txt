Fuck this Assignment Looks difficult as fuck holy shit
30 days simulated

==========ARCHITECTURE==========

The buildings are laid out in a 4x4 Array
    buildings
        Solar Panel = Adds energy (SP)
        Greenhouse = Adds Water   (GH)
        Hab Dome = Adds Oxygen and a cap on the number of colonists (HD)
        Electrolyser = Adds Oxygen (EL)
        Empty = Empty slot (N/A)
    
The colonists are in a list
    Colonist Properties
        Each colonist has a name, job and health
        Each colonist consumes one water and one Oxygen a day
        If there are no resources available, they take damage
        If health is zero, they die
        People are born and people die

Encapsulation
    Resources as Properties
        Oxygen
        Water
        Energy
    Logic
        Clamp to 0 and 100
        If oxygen is below 20, raise a flag that prints an alert to the console

==========SIMULATION==========
Runs for 30 days

Event Phase
    Random shit has a chance of happening every day
        Meteor strike = hits a random space and destroys equipment
        Plague = decreases health
        Failure = equipment underperforms on that day

Production Phase
    Scans the map to evaluate resources
    Adds to resource Properties

Consumption Phase
    Loops through the list to see how the resources are used
    Deduct resources
    Check deaths and do the shi

Report Phase
    Print the day number, population count, resource levels.

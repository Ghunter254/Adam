Step 1, UI Cleaning and Method Research
1. CURRENCY FORMATTING
   - We don't want to see "1500.555555". We want "$1,500.56".
   - Search Term: "C# string format currency".
            Results
             You have to declare the shi and then pass it as a variable in the function lowkey

            decimal amount = 1921.39m;  //The m makes it so that it is treated like a decimal number and not a double
            String.Format("Whatever text is in here: {0:C}, amount");

2. COMPOUND INTEREST MATH
   - The formula for a mortgage payment involves powers (exponents).
   - You cannot write `number ^ 10` in C#.
   - Search Term: "C# Math.Pow example".
            Results
                We use a Math.Pow method to exponentify shi
                define a base and define an exponent and then plug them into the function
                Math.Pow(base,exponent)

3. CONSOLE CLEANING
   - When the user passes qualification, clear the screen so the report 
     looks like a fresh document.
   - Search Term: "C# Console.Clear".
            Results
